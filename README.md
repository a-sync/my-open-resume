# OpenResume
[OpenResume](https://open-resume.com) is a powerful open-source resume builder and resume parser.  
[This fork](https://github.com/a-sync/my-open-resume) focuses on the builder part and adds QoL features to provide a customizable resume on your personal website.  

The default content of the resume is loaded from the [./public/assets/defaultState.json](./public/assets/defaultState.json) file.  
Holding down <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Alt/Opt</kbd> and tapping <kbd>Shift</kbd> toggles the import and export buttons.  

Some of the other fixes and features are merged from other [community forks](https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume/network).
